In the cases of servicing/ repair by manufacturer or authorized servicing agent/ proprietary jobs,
for value of work below ` 15 lakhs, the estimates will be based on the offer obtained from the
manufacturers/ service agent/ proprietary concern.

All such works being proposed to be awarded on nomination through OEM/Authorized Service
Agent need to be routed and recommended by the ‘Expert Committee’ for nomination works in
Works Division.

For works above the value of ` 15 lakhs the proposal will be routed through Works Contracts
Department.

In case the proposal is routed through Works Contracts Department, the offers will be negotiated
by a committee to be convened by Works Contracts at a level equal to LTE cases for such
estimated values, and recommended for approval.

At the beginning of the year, FMD and/or concerned department will obtain the listed prices for
spares & services from the respective OEM/Authorized Service Agent.
The prices will be negotiated for price reduction/rebate by a committee consisting of the HOD
concerned, a member from Finance and the Engineer for the work, as per the Delegation of
Powers.

In the above negotiation procedure, while obtaining the offers, all efforts will be made to keep
the prices “firm” for a period of 12 months (or) 6 months, based on mutually agreed terms and
conditions.

The committee as above shall duly recommend with appropriate justification, the final negotiated
prices for various items for the approval of competent authority.

The list of approved prices for various spares and services shall be forwarded to Finance
(General Accounts). On execution of a job, and with the recommendation of the Engineer,
Finance shall process the bills, raised for the period for which approved rates are applicable.
In case, the replacement of any spare/ services not appearing in the list of items with listed price
is necessitated, prices will be negotiated by the committee mentioned at Cl#8.3.1.2 for each
individual item/ service.

All the works awarded on nomination to OEMs/Authorized Service Agents shall be put up to the
BoD, post-facto, on a quarterly basis, by MMS for information.
